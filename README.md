# hi! my name is brandon
i'm a self taught full stack developer with a degree in marketing.

i learned how to code so i could create soundsteer, an ai music management tool for artist and managers.

i was originally an artist and wanted to turn my idea of having an ai manager into a real project.

# my work
i did the entire implementation of the following features.

## meet alex, your own personal ai music manager
- developled ai agent that has context of user data
- created playlist tool for users to search for spotify playlists with contact info

## generate an entire content plan with one button
- built tool for users to create an ai-generated content plan for promoting their single
- implemented system called auto track, where posts made during a campaign are automatically tracked and visualized

aside from those features i'm particulary proud of, i did a lot of other stuff:

- spearheaded the design of our entire database schema and created key DB functions
- designed and implemented essential frontend components for displaying user data
- conducted extensive user interviews with artists and managers / indie labels
