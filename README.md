# Hi! My name is Brandon
I'm a self-taught full stack developer with a degree in marketing.

I learned how to code so I could create Soundsteer, an AI music management tool for artists and managers.

I was originally an artist and wanted to turn my idea of having an AI manager into a real project.

# My Work
I did the entire implementation of the following features.

## Meet Alex, your own personal AI music manager
- Developed an AI agent that has context of user data and provides tailored advice
- Created a playlist tool for users to search for Spotify playlists with contact info

## Generate an entire content plan with one button
- Built a tool for users to create an AI-generated content plan for promoting their single
- Implemented a system called Auto Track, where posts made during a user's campaign are automatically tracked and visualized

Aside from those features I'm particularly proud of, I did a lot of other stuff:

- Architected and maintain pivotal microservices
- Spearheaded the design of our entire database schema and created key DB functions
- Designed and implemented essential frontend components for displaying user data
- Conducted extensive user interviews with artists and managers / indie labels

# What's next?
I'm currently exploring new opportunites in the areas of product management, sales, and software.
