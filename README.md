# Hi! My name is Brandon
I'm a self-taught full stack developer with a degree in marketing. You can download my resume [here](https://github.com/brandonhresko/brandonhresko/blob/bc2cf74adbc1d7eb9aa70cd60aa64cac49116700/TPM%20Brandon%20Hresko%20Resume.docx.pdf).

I learned how to code so I could create Soundsteer, an AI music management tool for artists and managers.

I was originally an artist and wanted to turn my idea of having an AI manager into a real project.

# My Work
I did the entire implementation of the following features.

## Meet Alex, your own personal AI music manager
- Developed an AI agent that has context of user data and provides tailored advice
- Created a playlist tool for users to search for Spotify playlists with contact info

## Generate an entire content plan with one button
- Built a tool for users to create an AI-generated content plan for promoting their single
- Implemented a system called Auto Track, where posts made during a user's campaign are automatically tracked and visualized
